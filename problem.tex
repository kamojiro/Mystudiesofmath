\section{Problem}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Riemann-Lebesgue extension?
  \item Let $u_t$ be a left regular rep. By Stone's theorem, there exists a positive self-adjpint op. $A$ on ${\rm L}^2(\R)$. What is $A$?
  \item Tomita algebra example
  \item various spectrum of modular op.
  \item Naimark's problem:C*algebra with only irreducible representation up to unitary equivalence, this is compact op. It is solved when including sep. C*-algebra and typeI C*-algebra. 1708.04368
  \item pure extention problem
  \item modular theory for abelian von Neumann algebra
  \item Connes' bicentralizer property:
  \item locally compact case $C_r^*(G) = C^*(G)$.
  \item locally compact case amenable radical
